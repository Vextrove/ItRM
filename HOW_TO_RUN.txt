How to run:

1. Create an empty folder called 'tweets', and make sure it is NOT set to read-only, or you will not be able to download tweets
2. Create a txt file called 'username.txt' that includes your Karora username {username}@karora.let.rug.nl
3. Run select_random_tweets.py. It will generate a 'download_tweets.bat' that will be used to download tweets
4. Run 'download_tweets.bat' and log in to Karora to download the tweets
5. Run measure_tweets.py
