# Research Question
On November 8th 2017, Twitter doubled its tweet character limit from 140 to 280. Has doubling
the character limit caused Twitter users to provide more arguments supporting their opinions than
Twitter?
## Motivation
Twitter as a platform has a considerable impact on society on politics.
However, some people say that Twitter is not a good platform for discourse. This claim often
includes the argument that the character limit makes it necessary for Twitter users to be concise and
to the point, implying that this does not contribute to effective, productive or otherwise meaningful
discussion.
This argument is often met with the counterargument that the doubling of the character limit
has made it possible for Twitter users to discuss topics better. This research could show whether
people have indeed been using the extra characters in tweets to provide more arguments for their
statements.
## Hypothesis
The hypothesis is that there will be a relative increase in the number of arguments provided for
statements in Tweets after November 8th 2017, which would show that the doubling of the character
limit has made it easier for people to convey reasons for their statements or opinions.
## Methodology
Subordinating conjunctions are words such as ”because”, ”therefore” and ”thus”, and they signal
arguments supporting a statement in a sentence. Matras (1997) The rate of arguments supporting
statements in tweets can be determined by measuring the amount of subordinating conjunctions in
that tweet.
I will use a computer program to count the number of Dutch and English subordinating conjunctions, in two samples of tweets from before and after November 8th 2017. I will obtain these
two samples of tweets from the Twitter corpus, which contains tweets sorted by year, month and
day.
If the hypothesis holds true, the increase or decrease in the number of subordinating conjunctions
in tweets posted before November 8th 2017 relative to the number of subordinating conjunctions
in tweets posted after November 8th 2017 will be identical for Dutch and English tweets.
## Contingency Matrix
Tweets before November 8th 2017 after November 8th 2017
Amount of subordinating conjunctions found ??? ???
The independent variable is whether a tweet is posted before or after the doubling of the character limit. The dependant variable is the amount of subordinating conjunctions in tweets.
